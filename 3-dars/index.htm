                </h2>
                <p>
                    What this specification calls a <em>character encoding</em> is known by different names in other
                    specifications (which may cause some confusion). However, the concept is largely the same across the
                    Internet. Also, protocol headers, attributes, and parameters referring to character encodings share
                    the same name -- "charset" -- and use the same values from the <a style="color: red;"
                        href="">[IANA]</a> registry (see <a style="color: green;" href="">[CHARSETS]</a> for a complete
                    list).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "charset" parameter identifies a character encoding, which is a method of converting a sequence
                    of bytes into a sequence of characters. This conversion fits naturally with the scheme of Web
                    activity: servers send HTML documents to user agents as a stream of bytes; user agents interpret
                    them as a sequence of characters. The conversion method can range from simple one-to-one
                    correspondence to complex switching schemes or algorithms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A simple one-byte-per-character encoding technique is not sufficient for text strings over a
                    character repertoire as large as <a style="color: red;" href="">[ISO10646]</a>. There are several
                    different encodings of parts of <a style="color: red;" href="">[ISO10646]</a> in addition to
                    encodings of the entire character set (such as UCS-4).

                <p>
                    Authoring tools (e.g., text editors) may encode HTML documents in the character encoding of their
                    choice, and the choice largely depends on the conventions used by the system software. These tools
                    may employ any convenient encoding that covers most of the characters contained in the document,
                    provided the encoding is <a href="">correctly labeled</a>. Occasional characters that fall outside
                    this encoding may still be represented by <a href="">character references</a>. These always refer to
                    the document character set, not the character encoding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Servers and proxies may change a character encoding (called <em>transcoding</em> ) on the fly to
                    meet the requests of user agents (see section 14.2 of <a style="color: red;" href="">[RFC2616]</a>,
                    the "Accept-Charset" HTTP request header). Servers and proxies do not have to serve a document in a
                    character encoding that covers the entire document character set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Commonly used character encodings on the Web include ISO-8859-1 (also referred to as "Latin-1";
                    usable for most Western European languages), ISO-8859-5 (which supports Cyrillic), SHIFT_JIS (a
                    Japanese encoding), EUC-JP (another Japanese encoding), and UTF-8 (an encoding of ISO 10646 using a
                    different number of bytes for different characters). Names for character encodings are
                    case-insensitive, so that for example "SHIFT_JIS", "Shift_JIS", and "shift_jis" are equivalent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This specification does not mandate which character encodings a user agent must support.

                <p>
                    <a href="">Conforming user agents</a> must correctly map to ISO 10646 all characters in any
                    character encodings
                    that they recognize (or they must behave as if they did).

                    When HTML text is transmitted in UTF-16 (charset=UTF-16), text data should be transmitted in network
                    byte order ("big-endian", high-order byte first) in accordance with <a style="color: red;"
                        href="">[ISO10646]</a>, Section 6.3 and <a style="color: red;" href="">[UNICODE]</a>, clause C3,

                <p>
                    Furthermore, to maximize chances of proper interpretation, it is recommended that documents
                    transmitted as UTF-16 always begin with a ZERO-WIDTH NON-BREAKING SPACE character (hexadecimal FEFF,
                    also called Byte Order Mark (BOM)) which, when byte-reversed, becomes hexadecimal FFFE, a character
                    guaranteed never to be assigned. Thus, a user-agent receiving a hexadecimal FFFE as the first bytes
                    of a text would know that bytes have to be reversed for the remainder of the text.

                <h2 id="block2.2" style="color: blue;">5.2.2 Specifying the character encoding</h2>
                <p>
                    How does a server determine which character encoding applies for a document it serves? Some servers
                    examine the first few bytes of the document, or check against a database of known files and
                    encodings. Many modern servers give Web masters more control over charset configuration than old
                    servers do. Web masters should use these mechanisms to send out a "charset" parameter whenever
                    possible, but should take care not to identify a document with the wrong "charset" parameter value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How does a user agent know which character encoding has been used? The server should provide this
                    information. The most straightforward way for a server to inform the user agent about the character
                    encoding of the document is to use the "charset" parameter of the "Content-Type" header field of the
                    HTTP protocol (<a style="color: red;" href="">[RFC2616]</a>, sections 3.4 and 14.17) For example,
                    the following HTTP header announces
                    that the character encoding is EUC-JP:
                </p>
                <code style="margin-left: 30px; color: brown;">
                    Content-Type: text/html; charset=EUC-JP
                </code>
                <p>
                    Please consult the section on <a href="">conformance</a> for the definition of <a
                        href="">text/html</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The HTTP protocol (<a style="color: red;" href="">[RFC2616]</a>, section 3.7.1) mentions ISO-8859-1
                    as a default character encoding
                    when the "charset" parameter is absent from the "Content-Type" header field. In practice, this
                    recommendation has proved useless because some servers don't allow a "charset" parameter to be sent,
                    and others may not be configured to send the parameter. Therefore, user agents must not assume any
                    default value for the "charset" parameter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To address server or configuration limitations, HTML documents may include explicit information
                    about the document's character encoding; the <a href=""><code>META</code></a> element can be used to
                    provide user agents with
                    this information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, to specify that the character encoding of the current document is "EUC-JP", a document
                    should include the following <a href=""><code>META</code></a> declaration:
                </p>
                <code style="margin-left: 30px; color: brown;">
                    < META http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=EUC-JP">
                </code>
                <p>
                    The <a href=""><code>META</code></a> declaration must only be used when the character encoding is
                    organized such that ASCII-valued bytes stand for ASCII characters (at least until the <a
                        href=""><code>META</code></a> element is parsed). <a href=""><code>META</code></a> declarations
                    should appear as early as possible in the <a href=""><code>HEAD</code></a> element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For cases where neither the HTTP protocol nor the <a href=""><code>META</code></a> element provides
                    information about the
                    character encoding of a document, HTML also provides the <a href=""><code>charset</code></a>
                    attribute on several elements. By
                    combining these mechanisms, an author can greatly improve the chances that, when the user retrieves
                    a resource, the user agent will recognize the character encoding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To sum up, conforming user agents must observe the following priorities when determining a
                    document's character encoding (from highest priority to lowest):

                    <li>A <a href=""><code>META</code></a> declaration with "http-equiv" set to "Content-Type" and a
                        value set for "charset".</li>
                    <li>The <a href=""><code>charset</code></a> attribute set on an element that designates an external
                        resource.</li>

                <p>
                    In addition to this list of priorities, the user agent may use heuristics and user settings. For
                    example, many user agents use a heuristic to distinguish the various encodings used for Japanese
                    text. Also, user agents typically have a user-definable, local default character encoding which they
                    apply in the absence of other indicators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    User agents may provide a mechanism that allows users to override incorrect "charset" information.
                    However, if a user agent offers such a mechanism, it should only offer it for browsing and not for
                    editing, to avoid the creation of Web pages marked with an incorrect "charset" parameter.

                    A given character encoding may not be able to express all characters of the document character set.
                    For such encodings, or when hardware or software configurations do not allow users to input some
                    document characters directly, authors may use SGML character references. Character references are a
                    character encoding-independent mechanism for entering any character from the document character set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Character references in HTML may appear in two forms:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Numeric character references (either decimal or hexadecimal).</li>
                    <li>Character entity references.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Character references within comments have no special meaning; they are comment data only.
                </p>
                <p style="color: green; margin-left: 30px;">
                    <em><strong>Note</strong>. HTML provides other ways to present character data, in particular <a
                            href="">inline images</a>.</em>
                </p>
                <p style="color: green; margin-left: 30px;">
                    <em><strong>Note</strong>. In SGML, it is possible to eliminate the final ";" after a character
                        reference in some cases (e.g., at a line break or immediately before a tag). In other
                        circumstances it may not be eliminated (e.g., in the middle of a word). We strongly suggest
                        using the ";" in all cases to avoid problems with user agents that require this character to be
                        present.</em>

                    <i>Numeric</i> character references specify the code position of a character in the document
                    character set. Numeric character references may take two forms:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The syntax "&#<i>D</i>;", where <i>D</i> is a decimal number, refers to the ISO 10646 decimal
                        character number
                        <i>D</i> .
                    </li>
                    <li>The syntax "&#x<i>H</i>;" or "&#X<i>H</i>;", where <i>H</i> is a hexadecimal number, refers to
                        the ISO 10646 hexadecimal character number H. Hexadecimal numbers in numeric character
                        references are case-insensitive</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Here are some examples of numeric character references:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>& #229; (in decimal) represents the letter "a" with a small circle above it (used, for example,
                        in Norwegian).</li>
                    <li>& #xE5; (in hexadecimal) represents the same character.</li>
                    <li>& #Xe5; (in hexadecimal) represents the same character as well.</li>
                    <li>& #1048; (in decimal) represents the Cyrillic capital letter "I".</li>
                    <li>& #x6C34; (in hexadecimal) represents the Chinese character for water.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="color: green; margin-left: 30px">
                    <em><strong>Note</strong>. Although the hexadecimal representation is not defined in <a

                        useful since character standards generally use hexadecimal representations.</em>

                <p>
                    In order to give authors a more intuitive way of referring to characters in the document character
                    set, HTML offers a set of <i>character entity references</i>. Character entity references use
                    symbolic names so that authors need not remember <a href="">code positions</a>. For example, the
                    character entity reference & aring; refers to the lowercase "a" character topped with a ring; "&
                    aring;" is easier to remember than & #229;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML 4 does not define a character entity reference for every character in the document character
                    set. For instance, there is no character entity reference for the Cyrillic capital letter "I".
                    Please consult the <a href="">full list of character references</a> defined in HTML 4.

                <p>
                    A user agent may not be able to render all characters in a document meaningfully, for instance,
                    because the user agent lacks a suitable font, a character has a value that may not be expressed in
                    the user agent's internal character encoding, etc.
                    <br> <br>
                    Because there are many different things that may be done in such cases, this document does not
                    prescribe any specific behavior. Depending on the implementation, undisplayable characters may also
                    be handled by the underlying display system and not the application itself. In the absence of more
                    sophisticated behavior, for example tailored to the needs of a particular script or language, we
                    recommend the following behavior for user agents:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Adopt a clearly visible, but unobtrusive mechanism to alert the user of missing resources.</li>
                    <li>
                        If missing characters are presented using their numeric representation, use the hexadecimal (not
                        decimal) form since this is the form used in character set standards.
                        previous
                    </li>
